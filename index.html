<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Discussion on the possibilities</h3>

<p> When Facebook bought Whatsapp, I was wondering whether they made a bad 
decision. Because many tech articles that came out just highlighted either overtly or otherwise the big price paid, 
one might come out with the perception that it was a bad deal. But if you really try to imagine the possible 
features which social network giant Facebook might built into this mobile social network, the deal could be the best decision Facebook has made.</p>

<p>I read a article titled <a href="platformed.info/the-trie-framework-platforms/">"HOW TO DESIGN THE AIRBNB FOR X, 
THE UBER FOR Y AND THE TWITTER FOR Z".</a> The article promotes the platform based thinking rather than an application thinking. Inspired by it, I started thinking about Whatsapp as a platform. Below are some of my musings</p>

<p>Currently, we think of Whatsapp as a facilitator for group-chat. But we shouldn't fool ourselves
into thinking this to be the sole only way to use it. There could possible other ways to organize
around Whatsapp platform.<p>

<p>Whatsapp, as it currently exists, is a collection of star networks. Servers being central nodes while
mobile clients being leaf nodes. Whatsapp platform provides certain guarantee. i.e. message delivery guarantee.</p>

<p>One can build host of other applications on this guarantee as I will explain below.
Assume Whatsapp platform provides some primitives to developers in form of API </p>
<ol>
<li>Message primitives or types</li>
<li>Display primitives or types (ways to display the message within Whatsapp)</li>
<li>Message delivery guarantee.</li>
</ol>

<p>Using these three, one can think innovative Whatsapp plugins. </p>

<h3>Below are few examples of developer plugins:</h3>

<ol>


<li><h6>Getting real-time feedback from students, etc</h6>
A plugin which allows you to create transient wifi-based whatsapp group which can be used to get
responses from people 
e.g. A professor can get responses from students on MCQs.
</li> 


<li><h6>Comparison applications</h6>
e.g. a wife is buying tiles for new house and shows final two to her husband through whatsapp to get his opinion.<br />
e.g. price comparison information for small traders with smart-phones.
</li> 


<li><h6>Information Dissemination</h6>
Mega-groups spreading relevant news from sources like police, government, traffic police, etc <br />
E.g. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-26462576">India police use WhatsApp to trace missing boy</a>
</li> 

<li><h6>Specialized groups used by hospitals or big shopping malls for sending out sale information. </h6>
Let's say I have a persistent heart risk. I need to be connected to my doctor or a hospital so that I could be given 
expert advice more easily. e.g.<a href="http://www.mumbaimirror.com/mumbai/others/Docs-use-WhatsApp-to-save-heart-patients/articleshow/27252815.cms"> Docs use WhatsApp to save heart patients </a> <br />
Or think about the following scenario. I visited Dr. Sahu's website who is an eye specialist. 
On the website I have a link where I need to get myself Oauthed by facebook and provide my phone. My phone number 
would then be added to the Dr. Sahu's custom whatsapp group handled by his secretary. She would approve my number 
and would answer my queries and provide relevant information like hospital's address, today's appointment times, etc.
</li> 

<li><h6>Whatsapp as Meta-App with plugins to cross-share content from other apps</h6>
E.g. Cross-sharing of content from other apps using message types and display primitives made available in API:

<ol><i><h7>Few examples below.</h7></i>
      <li>Quora Answer</li>
      <li>Sharing a tweet.</li>
      <li>9gags funny images to my whatsapp friends </li>
      <li>Sharing a funny vine.</li>
      <li>Instagram photo </li>
</ol>
This would be useful since my friends trust me for scavenging for good content but they themselves don't have time to go through the information streams (of 9gags, vines, twitter, etc)
</li>

<li><h6>Applications within Universities</h6>
Universities could have specialized Whatsapp groups so that students don't have to check websites or inboxes for latest information on the venue of examination halls, events, etc. Or Whatsapp could ping a student requesting him to check his inbox to get more information.
</li>

<li><h6>Applications within Companies</h6>
Companies already have "email-lists" to reach different groups of employees for different reasons. Facebook could 
make it easier for companies to create groups for handling company environment needs. Facebook would provide 
additional guarantees for operating with company security restrictions.
</li>


<li><h6>Table Booking in Restaurant</h6>
I don't need a fancy app to book a table in restaurant. I just need a message from that restaurant's Whatsapp contact "okaying" my reservation. This would double up as a proof that indeed that they booked my table. This would avoid calling altogether.<br /><br />
Let's say I search for nearby restaurant. On the restaurant's details icon on the map, I have a Whatsapp icon which would launch add me to Restaurant's whatsapp group on a one-to-one basis so that I can carry conversation with restaurant's attendant and receive information. Sometimes phone lines are busy so I don't need to wait this way. I am sure that in due time, I will get a reply from the restaurant.
</li>

<li><h6>Pull based interactive Whatsapp services</h6>
E.g. Here mobile clients are initiating the interaction, thus pull from mobile clients. Few examples are below to explain what I mean by this :
<ul>
<li>Justdial is yellowpages website provides information to callers. Assume Justdail has developed a web-based automated Whatsapp endpoint which can answer user queries based on keywords. This would reduce costs since traffic is now diverted away from calls.</li>
<li>Imagine Dominos, Pizza Hut have developed a Whatsapp "intelligent" endpoint which can process user order consisting of item numbers and confirmation. If "Payment Gateway" plugin is implemented then one can even pay through Whatsapp itself and confirm order. If not, the application can always launch a browser and process payments there. This would reduce costs since traffic is now diverted away from calls. This model could be boon for small local food chains such as <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasuben_Pizza">Jasuben Pizza</a>.</li>
<li>Lot of us subscribe to sites which provide daily <i>jokes, horoscopes, thought for the day,</i> etc. I can subscribe to such services and they would provide me "jokes, horoscopes, thoughts" either daily or on demand.</li>
<li>Call centers currently operate totally on human interaction. Most of the initial interaction between the caller and the handler consists of furnishing data by the caller. This step can be moved to the text based Whatsapp conversation. Most of the call initiation is handled through recorded voice where user inputs data following instructions. These steps can be small discretized audio messages from the company's Whatsapp endpoint. Once the relevant details are provided, then they can carry on their conversation on phone. Many times, people have to wait for their calls to get processed. It's not that people aren't ready to wait they just need a guarantee that their requests, complaints are heard if not immediately may be few hours later. This way call centers can allow themselves to operate 24 hrs where the calls that come outside the range of working hours will be logged in "waitlog" which will be processed the next working day. This "delayed request response" way of conducting business could be useful in other scenarios as well.</li>
</ul>

</li>

<li><h6>Increasing presence and easy adoption of Whatsapp API, plugins. </h6>
Today, sites feature different share options [like button, G+ button, etc].
Some of the websites mentioned above (like Justdial, Daily Horoscopes, Daily Thoughts, Daily News Headlines, Daily 
Stock Updates for selected stocks) etc would feature a "Whatsapp" icon. After going through the joining process, 
user provided mobile number would start receiving nicely formatted, crafted messages or updates. It's totally site's 
responsibility on how to handle incoming messages and generate appropriate replies based on available primitives.
</li> 

<li><h6>Metadata</h6>All those "relevant messages" flowing through Facebook servers could create goldmine of metadata for which advertisers and small businesses would go ape-hungry.</li> 



<li> <h6>Board Games</h6> I have heard that long distance friends used to play chess in olden days using letters. Today, we have email based chess, where players can play their turn leisurely.
Imagine playing multi-player board games like chess, othello, etc in a group so that your friends can watch or separately between two individuals which could be matched randomly or based on skill level to your opponent as a laid back leisure activity. I would love if I could play pocket tanks with my friends over Whatsapp. Any simple turn-based addictive game would flourish in such environment. The reason why this would be good is "these games are organically building on top of already present social network and message delivery guarantees".</li>

<li> <h6>Single Player Games or Small utilities</h6>
I heard a ted talk by <a href="http://www.shapshak.com/"> Toby Shapshak</a> on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6vIq6_1OE">"You don't need an app for that"</a>. 
In this talk, he says how some African countries have solved problems using very 
simple Nokia phones and SMS messaging. They are even providing banking services. Now, this idea of "You 
don't need an app for that" can be extended and applied to "thin" apps. What if a developer's idea is so simple 
that focusing on building a social network and handling incoming and outgoing messages would be overkill. Also, 
being simple, the app is likely to get lost in App ecosystem. Also virality due to social sharing would be 
impossible task. <br />
Consider this simple addictive game <a href="gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/"> 2048 Tile Game </a>
</li>

<li> <h6>Viral Marketing</h6> 
A social network is a very fertile place for viral advertising.
Using the display primitives available in the API, advertising companies can build creative, funny ads.
This could server as another potential revenue stream in future.
</li>

<li> <h6>Email Alert API </h6> 
Now every email service (especially universities and companies) won't make a mobile app for their users. But they 
can surely take advantage of email alert notification api to those people whose email ids and mobiles are connected 
through Whatsapp API. Thus sending full email, they would also send email alert to clients so that users can check 
email on desktop clients like outlook, Thunderbird or on web.</li>

<li> <h6>Ephemeral Message Types using examples of Spotify / Snapchat plugin.</h6>
Deleting a content after watching it for certain number of times may be required as a message delivery guarantee. 
Snapchat is like that. Let's say I have spotify account and I listen to a very great song. I want my friend to like 
spotify service but he is reluctant. I can send good songs on his whatsapp and he would listen to the song 3-4 times 
and then that message would get deleted. Thus this similar to previews cum advertising but only done organically.
<br />
One can easily implement <a href="http://omegle.com/">Omegle</a> and <a href="http://chatroulette.com/">Chatroulette</a> on top of such message or session guarantees.
</li>

<li><h6>Payment Gateway plugin and money transfer services :</h6>
If whatsapp allows people to clear accounts easily then that would be a great services.
Splitting a bill exactly after going on a lunch with friends would be piece of cake with such services.
Also, temporary loaning out money etc would be handy. Who needs square? Who needs all those fancy bloated apps. Direct competition to Google wallet.</li>

<li> <h6>Translator Services Plugin:</h6> 
Imagine a service which allows one to translate audio using professional translators and facilitates
conversations between people of different nationalities. A French businessman would send his audio to the service. The service would internally route the audio and get it translated by its translators and send it to Japanese manufacturer. Please read about the social duolingo app which allows people to 
learn languages easily. <a href="businessinsider.in/This-Brilliant-Entrepreneur-Is-Making-Money-Off-You-Without-You-Even-Noticing/articleshow/31966336.cms">Duolingo</a> also provides translating services to news media. 
</li>


</ol> 


<p>
Facebook is in unique position because it now has a fastest growing mobile messaging app which could become more 
popular once it acquires features as described above. Since websites like Justdial, call centers, foodchains, local 
take-out eateries, etc would require something similar to mini-apache server running and processing incoming 
Whatsapp messages from mobile clients and responding to them. The mini-Apache server would either reside on a local 
computer or a webserver or on mobile clients serving a unique Endpoint or multiple Endpoints. 
</p>


<p>
Supporting ephemeral message primitives, Whatsapp could support Snapchat-like features. Buy focussing on anonymous 
featues, it can target apps like Whisper. Developers are relieved of major responsibilities since Whatsapp provides 
them out of box. Apps relying on social network could really benefit if Facebook makes them available to developers. 
Facebook might keep a tight control over the "plugin" ecosystem. This would bemeta-ecosystem on top Google Play 
since the apps within this ecosystem rely on underlying social network heavily.
