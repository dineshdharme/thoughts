I am great fan of open source technologies. I have following idea. I would like to know your opinion on this. Is the idea powerful enough for some company to take it as a open platform project before Facebook does it? When Facebook bought Whatsapp, I was wondering whether they made a bad decision. Because many tech articles that came out just highlighted either implicitly or overtly the big price paid, I thought of it as a bad deal. But I set out to think of the possibilities on could do if Facebook utilities the mobile social network to its advantage.

Some days ago, I was reading this article http://platformed.info/the-tri...
titled "HOW TO DESIGN THE AIRBNB FOR X, THE UBER FOR Y AND THE TWITTER FOR Z"
So, I started thinking about Whatsapp which was recently acquired by Facebook as a platfrom
and what all could possibly be supported in future.

Currently, we think of Whatsapp as a facilitator for group-chat. But we shouldn't fool ourselves
into thinking this to be the sole only way to use it. There could possible other ways to organize
around Whatsapp platform.

Whatsapp, as it currently exists, is a collection of star networks. Servers being central nodes while
mobile clients being leaf nodes. Whatsapp platform provides certain guarantee. i.e. message delivery guarantee.

One can build host of other applications on this guarantee as I will explain below.
Assume Whatsapp platform provides some primitives to developers: 
a) message primitives or types
b) display primitives or types (ways to display the message within Whatsapp)
c) message delivery guarantee.

Using these three, one can think innovative Whatsapp plugins. I will describe the possible display primitives and message primitives in details later.

Few ideas for plugins made by users:
1] Getting real-time feedback from students, etc
A plugin which allows you to create transient wifi-based whatsapp group which can be used to get
responses from people 
e.g. A professor can get responses from students on MCQs.

2] Comparison applications.
e.g. a wife is buying tiles for new house and shows final two to her husband through whatsapp to get his opinion.
e.g. price comparison information for small traders with smart-phones.

3] Information Dissemination : Mega-groups spreading relevant news from sources like police, government, traffic police, etc
e.g. http://www.bbc.com/news/world-... : India police use WhatsApp to trace missing boy

4] Specialized groups used by hospitals or big shopping malls for sending out sale information. 
Let's say I have a persistent heart risk. I need to be connected to my doctor or a hospital so that I could be given expert advice more easily. e.g. http://www.mumbaimirror.com/mu...
Or think about the following scenario. I visited Dr. Sahu's website who is an eye specialist. 
On the website I have a link where I need to get myself Oauthed by facebook and provide my phone. My phone number would then be added to the Dr. Sahu's custom whatsapp group handled by his secretary. She would approve my number and would answer my queries and provide relevant information like hospital's address, today's appointment times, etc.

5] Whatsapp as Meta-App with plugins to cross-share content from other apps. 
E.g. Cross-sharing of content from other apps using message types and display primitives made available in API:
My favourite Quora answer to my friends.
a) Sharing a tweet.
b) 9gags funny images as to my whatsapp friends 
c) Sharing a funny vine.
d) Instagram, etc photo

This would be useful since my friends trust me for scavenging for good content but they themselves don't have time to go through the information streams (of 9gags, vines, twitter, etc)

6] Universities could have specialized Whatsapp groups so that students don't have to check websites or inboxes for latest information on the venue of examination halls, events, etc. Or Whatsapp could ping a student requesting him to check his inbox to get more information.

7] Table Booking in Restaurant : 
I don't need a fancy app to book a table in restaurant. I just need a message from that restaurant's Whatsapp contact "okaying" my reservation. This would double up as a proof that indeed that they booked my table. This would avoid calling altogether.
Let's say I search for nearby restaurant. On the restaurant's details icon on the map, I have a Whatsapp icon which would launch add me to Restaurant's whatsapp group on a one-to-one basis so that I can carry conversation with restaurant's attendant and receive information. Sometimes phone lines are busy so I don't need to wait this way. I am sure that in due time, I will get a reply from the restaurant.

8] Pull based interactive Whatsapp services
E.g. Here mobile clients are initiating the interaction, thus pull from mobile clients. Few examples are below to explain what I mean by this :

a) Justdial is yellowpages website provides information to callers. Assume Justdail has developed a web-based automated Whatsapp endpoint which can answer user queries based on keywords. This would reduce costs since traffic is now diverted away from calls.

b) Imagine Dominos, Pizza huts have developed a Whatsapp "intelligent" endpoint which can process user inputs consisting of items and process orders and get confirmation. If "Payment Gateway" plugin is implemented then one can even pay through Whatsapp itself and confirm order. If not, the application can always launch a browser and process payments there. This would reduce costs since traffic is now diverted away from phones. Small local chains can easily replicate big chains customer handling models.

c) Lot of us subscribe to sites which provide daily jokes, horoscopes, thought of the day, etc. I can subscribe to such services and they would provide me "jokes, horoscopes, thoughts" either daily or on demand.

d) Call centers currently operate totally on human interaction. Most of the initial interaction between the caller and the handler consists of inputting of data by the caller. This step can be moved to the text based Whatsapp conversation. Most of the call initiation is handled through recorded voice where user inputs data following instructions. These steps can be small discretized audio messages from the company's Whatsapp endpoint. Once the relevant details are provided, then they can carry on their conversation on phone. Many times, people have to wait for their calls to get processed. It's not that people aren't ready to wait they just need a guarantee that their requests, complaints are heard if not immediately may be few hours later. This way call centers can allow themselves to operate 24 hrs where the calls that come outside the range of working hours falls into category of wait-calls which will be processed the next working day. I am just scratching the surface of this "delayed request response" way of doing things.

9] Increasing presence and easy adoption of Whatsapp API, plugins. 
Today, sites feature different share options [like button, G+ button, etc].
Some of the websites mentioned above (like Justdial, Daily Horoscopes, Daily Thoughts, Daily News Headlines, Daily Stock Updates for selected stocks) etc would feature a "Whatsapp" icon. After going through the joining process, user provided mobile number would start receiving nicely formatted, crafted messages or updates. It's totally sites' pejorative on how they handle incoming messages and generate appropriate response based on available primitives.

10 ] All those "relevant messages" flowing through Facebook servers could create goldmine of metadata for which advertisers and small businesses would go ape-hungry.

11] Companies already have "email-lists" to reach different groups of employees for different reasons. Facebook could make it easier for companies to create groups for handling company environment needs. Facebook would provide additional guarantees for operating with company security restrictions.

12] Board Games : I have heard that long distance friends used to play chess in olden days using letters. Today, we have email based chess, where players can play their turn leisurely.
Imagine playing multi-player board games like chess, othello, etc in a group so that your friends can watch or separately between two individuals which could be matched randomly or based on skill level to your opponent as a laid back leisure activity. I would love if I could play pocket tanks with my friends over Whatsapp. Any simple turn-based games. The reason why this would be good is "these games are organically building on top of already present social network and message delivery guarantees".

13] Single Player Games or Small utilities
I heard a ted talk by Toby Shapshak on "You don't need an app for that". You can watch it here : 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?... In this talk, he says that African countries have solved some problems using very simple nokia phones and sms messages. They have even built banking services on top of smses. Now, this idea of "You don't need an app for that" can be extended and applied to even first world countries. What if my idea is so simple that building a 
whole app would be overkill. This gave me an idea that what if a particular developer just needs to showcase his small addictive game. Making the developer jump through hopes to create a full fledged app for a very small functionality and getting lost into the whole app-ecosystem be overkill. Moreover, sharing would be a difficult task. If as a developer I have a small game then I should be able to socially suggest it to my friend and they should be able to play it on their phones. We are not talking about big games like Temple Run but small games like this 
http://gabrielecirulli.github....

14] User initiated viral marketing. Using the display primitives, companies can build creative funny ads.
15] Email Alert API : Now every email service (especially universities and companies) won't make a mobile app for their users. But they can surely take advantage of email alert notification api to those people whose email ids and mobiles are connected through Whatsapp API. Thus sending full email, they would also send email alert to clients so that users can check email on desktop clients like outlook, Thunderbird or on web.
16] Ephemeral Message Types using examples of Spotify / Snapchat plugin.
Deleting a content after watching it for certain number of times may be required as a message delivery guarantee. Snapchat is like that. Let's say I have spotify account and I listen to a very great song. I want my friend to like spotify service but he is reluctant. I can send good songs on his whatsapp and he would listen to the song 3-4 times and then that message would get deleted.
Thus this similar to previews cum advertising but only done organically.

17] Payment Gateway plugin and money transfer services :
If whatsapp allows people to clear accounts easily then that would be a great services.
Splitting a bill exactly after going on a lunch with friends would be piece of cake with such services.
Also, temporary loaning out money etc would be handy. Who needs square? Who needs all those fancy bloated apps. Direct competition to Google wallet.

18] Translator Services Plugin:
Imagine there exists a service which translates audio using professional translators and facilitates
conversations between people. Chinese guy would send his audio to the service. The service would route the audio internally and get that audio translated. Then the translator would speak it and pass it to other end. And back and forth. Translator service acting as a middleman. Please read about the social duolingo app which allows people to learn languages easily. Duolingo also provides translator services to news media.

Till this point I have praised Whatsapp because it provides the social network on top of which all these things can be easily provided. But some other ambitious project also do this very same things. Since Websities like Justdial, Call centers, Take-out eateries would require something similar to mini-Apache server running and processing Whatsapp messages coming other endpoints (mostly mobile clients). The mini-Apache server would either reside on a local computer or a webserver or on mobile clients. This we are kind of developing a full-stack application where all these components would fit together and provide these innovative services as I have described. Who needs a webserver when you have a control over "Endpoint"

Please point out mistakes, etc. Thanks for you time.
Critical comments are invited. If you find something is not clear, please shoot a mail back
and I will try my best to clarify. As I said before, I would love if some open source company
deliberates on this idea.
